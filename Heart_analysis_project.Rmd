## 1. Introduction

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally, accounting for millions of deaths annually. The ability to accurately predict heart disease can lead to early diagnosis and intervention, significantly reducing the mortality rate associated with this condition. This project aims to leverage data science and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the likelihood of heart attacks based on a wide range of factors including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and more.

Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, this analysis will explore various features that may influence heart disease, implement several machine learning models to predict heart disease occurrence, and evaluate the performance of these models. The dataset includes diverse variables, offering a comprehensive insight into the factors that might contribute to heart disease.

Through this project, we aim to uncover significant predictors of heart disease, assess the predictive power of machine learning models in a medical context, and ultimately, contribute to the efforts of preventing heart disease by enabling early detection. This endeavor is not only a technical challenge but also a crucial step towards saving lives and improving health outcomes.

As we delve into the data and models, our goal is to present a clear, concise, and informative analysis that can serve as a foundation for further research and practical applications in the field of medical science and public health.

### 1.1 Examining the Project Topic

#### What is Heart Attack?

![](image/WhatIsHeartAttack.png)


* The medical name of heart attack is “Myocardial infarction”.
* Heart attack in short; It is the occlusion of the vessel by plaque-like lesions filled with cholesterol and fat. 
* The lesion is called abnormal conditions that occur in the organs where the disease is located.
* As a result of the blockage, the blood flow is completely cut off and a heart attack that can lead to death occurs.

#### How does a heart attack occur?

![](image/Vessel.png)

* The heart is like an efficient pump, tirelessly working to circulate blood throughout the body about 60 to 80 times a minute when we're at rest. Just like any other part of the body, the heart itself needs a steady supply of nutrients and oxygen, which it gets through its very own set of blood vessels known as coronary arteries.

* Sometimes, these crucial arteries can have trouble with their blood flow due to blockages or narrowing, a condition known as coronary insufficiency. This issue can vary widely – it all depends on where the blockage is, how severe it is, and the specific arteries affected.

* For some, this might just mean chest pain that pops up during a workout or some physical task, but goes away once they take a break. However, in more serious cases, if a coronary artery gets suddenly completely blocked, it can trigger a heart attack. This often starts with intense chest pain and, in the worst-case scenario, can lead to sudden death.

### 1.2 Recognizing Variables In Dataset

```

##### 4.1.2.1 Analysis Outputs(2) <a id = 22></a>

#### Sex Variable
* **68%** of the patients are **male**, **32%** are **female**.
* So, the number of male patients is more than twice that of female patients.

#### Cp Variable
* Almost half of the patients have an observation value of 0. In other words, there is asymptomatic angina
* Half of the patients are asymptomatic; they have pain without symptoms.
* If we examine the other half of the pie chart, 1 out of 4 patients has an observation value of 2.
* In other words, atypical angina is in **29%** of the patients.
* This observation value shows patients with shortness of breath or non-classical pain.
* The other two observation values are less than the others.
* **16.5%** of patients have a value of 1. In other words, typical angina is seen. Typical angina is the classic exertion pain that comes during any physical activity.
* The other **8%** has the value of non-anginal pain, which is three types of angina.
* Non-anginal pain is the term used to describe chest pain that is not caused by heart disease or a heart attack.

#### Fbs Variable
* The vast majority of patients have an observation value of 1. In other words, **85%**.
* The fasting blood sugar of these patients is more than 120 mg/dl. 
* The remaining 15 percent have a less than 120 mg/dl fasting blood glucose level. 

#### Restecg Variable
* The thing that draws attention to the image of this variable is that the number of patients with two observation values is negligible. 
* It has a value of **1.3 percent**. When we look at all of these patients, **it is not a very important number**.
* This value represents the ST and T wavelengths of the patients.
* Another point that draws attention to this graph is; The total numbers of other patients with observation values of 1 and 0 are almost equal. 
* The size of those with 1, that is, the orange part on the graph is **50.2%**
* This means that the resting electrocardiographic results of these patients are **normal**. 
* The percentage of patients with a value of 0 is **48.5%**. 
* That is, the patients' values of **48.5%** are **normal**.

#### Exang Variable
* We have said that this variable stands for exercise-induced angina.
* Angina is the chest pain caused by the coronary artery's involuntary contraction that feeds the heart.
* According to the variable "exang," the pain caused by this angina is represented by a value of 1 if it occurs with any exercise and 0 if it does not.
* In this context, Values 0 are more than twice as values 1. More than half of the patients do not have exercise-induced angina.

#### Slp Variable
* The minimum observation value is 0 with **7 percent**. 
* This is patients with a downward slope of the ST wavelength.
* The other two observation values are almost equal to each other. 
* The ST wavelength of half of the remaining patients is 1, that is straight, while the observation value of the other half is 2, that is, the ST wavelength is sloped upwards.

#### Caa variable 
* This variable is the number of great vessels colored by fluoroscopy. 
* In more than half of the patients, **57.8 percent**, the number of large vessels is 0. That is, the number of large vessels colored by fluoroscopy is absent.
* After 0 observation value, the other value with the most slices in the pie chart 1
* The number of large vessels observed in **21.5%** of the patients is 1
* The majority of patients have an occlusion in their veins. Therefore, large vessels cannot be observed with the fluoroscopy technique.

#### Thall Variable
* The "Thal" variable is short for the "Thallium stress test."
* The thallium stress test is simply an imaging method that evaluates the amount of blood reaching the heart muscle and determines whether a person has coronary artery disease.
* There are three observation values in the description of this variable. However, the pie chart shows four values. Values **0, 1, 2 and 3**.
* According to our research, the observation value of 0 is null. Therefore, in the next step, 0 observation values will be returned to null and filled with logical data.
* In this context, according to the thallium stress test results, **54.8 percent** of the patients have two observation values, so the test result appears to be expected.
* **36.8 percent** has a value of **3**, so we can say that this value is a reversible defect as an explanation.
* **5.9 percent** of patients have a value of **1**, so the test result for these patients is a fixed defect.

#### Output Variable
* More than half of the patients, **54.5 percent**, have a heart attack risk. The remaining **45.5 percent** have no heart attack risk.

#### 4.2.3.1 Analysis Outputs(3)

##### Sex - Numeric Variables

* There is no very high correlation between "sex" and numerical variables. There is a weak relationship with all of them.
* When the boxes of the observation values ​​of the gender variable are examined, it is seen that it is difficult to distinguish from each other.

##### Output - Numeric Variables

* In the "old peak" variable, the median value of the blue box goes outside the red box. In other words, it shows that there is a more significant relationship between the "old peak" variable and the target compared to other numerical variables. We can say that there is a medium level of correlation.
* There is also a correlation between the "thalach" and the output variables. Again, the median of the blue box goes outside the red box. This is an indication that there is a correlation compared to the others.
* When we examine the other three variables, there is not much correlation.

#### 4.3 Relationships between variables

```{r}
cor_mat <- cor(Heart_data)
corrplot(cor_mat, method = "color", 
         addCoef.col = "black",   
         tl.cex = 0.8,

         tl.srt = 45,             
         order = "hclust" )            

```
#### 4.2.3.1 Analysis Outputs(4)

##### Age Variable

* The variable with the highest correlation with the "age" variable is the "thalachh" variable. There is a negative correlation between them, which we can call moderately. 
* The severity of the correlation is -0.40. In other words, there is an inverse relationship between the "age" and "thalachh" variables. 

##### Trtbps Variable

* The variable with the highest correlation with the "trtbps" variable is the "age" variable. The correlation between them is 0.28
* There is a positive low-intensity correlation.

##### Chol Variable

* The variable with the highest correlation with the "chol" variable is the "age" variable
* There is a correlation with a magnitude of 0.21. This is a low positive correlation. 
* So, we can say that as age increases, cholesterol also increases.

##### Thalachh Variable

* The variable with the highest correlation to the "Thalachh" variable is the "output" variable. 
* There is a 0.42 positive and moderate correlation between them. In other words, it is a variable that can directly trigger a heart attack.
* There is a variable with which this variable has many correlations. 
* It means that the maximum heart rate reached maybe a situation triggered by other variables.

##### Oldpeak Variable

* It has the most significant correlation ratio among this changing table. This correlation is -0.58 with the "slp" variable. 
* There is a negative correlation between them, which is slightly above medium intensity. 

##### Sex Variable

* There is no robust correlation between the variable "Sex" and other variables.

##### Fbs Variable

* The "Fbs" variable generally does not correlate with other variables. 
* The highest correlation with 0.18 belongs to the "trtbps" variable. There is a low positive correlation.

##### Restecg Variable

* There is no strong correlation between the "Rest_ecg" variable and other variables.
* The highest correlation was 0.14 with the "output" variable. There is a positive low-intensity correlation.

##### output Variable

* The "output" variable correlates with more than one variable.
